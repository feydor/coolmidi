CoolMidi
========
A MIDI parser, sequencer, and CLI player.
* Plays format 0 & 1 MIDI files
* A few different CLI UI options

And also what isn't supported (yet):
* Format 2 MIDI files
* Mid track tempo/time signature changes (right now setting global tempo as the first tempo change encountered)
* There's likely a lot MIDI files out their with broken headers that will raise an exception in CoolMIDI
